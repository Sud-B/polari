<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.5pt'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Jean Cocteau could have been writing about Polari when
he wrote in <i>Maalesh</i>: “What is really new is the written language.[…] The
new phonetic language is designed purely for the ear, and side-tracks sounds
which are difficult to pronounce. The eyes feel surprised by it. No doubt this
surprise will yield a rich harvest. It will give young writers the opportunity
of doing fresh things with a language which had formerly to be treated with
great respect, and which can now be used as disrespectfully as they like” (86).
Cocteau was writing about the changes Atatürk brought to Turkish during his
revolution in the early part of last century, when he abolished the Arabic
script for the Roman alphabet, but his words could equally apply to Polari and
its matrix language, English (except, perhaps, the bit about respect, for
English has endured at least a century of disrespect and experimentation, from
writers as illustrious as James Joyce, in his two masterpieces, <i>Ulysses</i>
and <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, to anonymous shrews and queens with sharp tongues).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Polari is a lingo or jargon whose heyday
was pre–Gay Liberation England, when there was a need not only for a gay slang,
which has always existed in English as long as there has been a gay
sensibility, whether it be British, American, South African or Australian, but
for a disguised language which could fool straight — that is, those who were
not the intended audience — eavesdroppers into thinking they were hearing a
foreign language. (And what usually happens when monoglots hear a string of
words they cannot make head nor tail of? They often dismiss it as gibberish and
pay no further attention, thereby giving the Polari speaker the cover that he —
and I suspect it was for the most part “he”, even though “she” was the
requisite and ubiquitous pronoun used; more on that later — that he so
desired.) The ironical thing about such jargons and cant is that it is usually
understood not only by the members of its loose-knit group but also by its
enemies, a very tight-knit organisation called the police. Remember: Polari
proliferated at a time when homosexuality was illegal. A common form of
entrapment used by the “Jennifer Justice” was to use a jargon word during
questioning, to see if the suspect understood. If he did, he stood condemned by
his own understanding. (“Jennifer Justice”, “Betty Bracelets”, “Hilda
Handcuffs” and “orderly daughters” are all gay slang words for the police;
however, <i>charpering omi</i>, or its variant, <i>sharpering omi</i>, often
abbreviated to just <i>sharpa</i>, is the true Polari word for policeman.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Slang is never far from Polari, even
when it has nothing to do with homosexuality. Certain Polari characteristics seem
to come “naturally” to slang, such as when Mr Cassidy in <i>Psycho</i> (1960)
tells Marian Crane’s boss, “Larry, I’m dying of thirsteroni” (spelled here as
Polari, for I have no idea how “thirsteroni” was spelled in Hitchcock’s
script). Such “augmented” words belong to the category that includes
“switcheroony”, from switch, and “smackeroony”, from smacker, slang for a
dollar or pound. It is quite common to hear people add a mock Italian “o”,
“oni” or “ooni” to the end of English words, to spice up their speech, as Mr
Cassidy did. (See <i>joynto</i> in the Vocabulary.) Some people, not to mention
multinationals, unaware of their own xenophobia, have even made the feeble joke
that to be understood in Italy (or <i>anywhere</i> on the Continent), all one
need do is add an “o” to the end of all the important words (“How mucho is a
bottle-o of vino?”; <i>cf</i>., a well-known brand of pasta sauce out of a
bottle marketed as “authentico”, which is neither fish nor fowl, linguistically
speaking). Then there is a short Australian children’s film about a
cross-dressing boy, that scooped an award at the 2010 Berlin Film Festival,
titled <i>Franswa Sharl</i>, almost perfect Polari (I would have written <i>Franswar</i>,
with the emphasis on the final syllable).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Polari is just one of a number of lingos
to proliferate in English, itself coming from an older such lingo called
Parlyaree, the language of travelling theatre and carnival folk (“carnies”),
circus performers and the like. “Kennick”, listed in <i>Chambers</i> dictionary
(neither Polari nor Parlyaree is), is tantalisingly defined as “the jargon of
tramping tinkers”, but without any elaboration, examples or etymology. What a
pity! I would have loved to sample a little of the jargon or just some tidbit
more on the subject, as <i>Chambers</i> does under the fourth entry for “bat”,
which is defined as a “spoken language of India or farther east”, and then
gives the verb phrase “sling the bat”, meaning to speak such a language. (It is
obvious I am a fan of <i>Chambers English Dictionary</i>, but I also checked
the treasury of Anglo-Indian, <i>Hobson-Jobson</i>, for more on the subject,
without success.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What I am proposing as Polari
orthography seems to come naturally to a lot of native English speakers. Poets
have been known to tinker with spelling, especially of the “little words” and
verbal terminations in their poems for various reasons (<i>e.g</i>., Robert
Duncan, Thom Gunn, the Beat Poets, the 1960s generation, <i>etc</i>.). An
example of this is Australian poet Rob Finlayson’s <i>In th Azure Room ov th Peacock
 Palace</i>, published in 1987. “The title introduces the reader immediately to
a statement on English orthography,” I wrote in a letter to the author at the
time. “The weakness of the English alphabet irks you, but how I miss the much
maligned mute <i>e</i>! [Some twenty years later, this may go to explain
somewhat why the mute “e” is present in my Polari orthography.] On the other
hand, I love the strength of V, I love its physical structure […] but poor mute
<i>e</i>! I love the mystery of silent letters (my [first] name has a silent
final consonant which represents for me that which is not spoken, the taboo of
ambisexuality). I love the transfigurations, the vowels shifts, the modulations
caused by mute <i>e</i>, but I see you take the matter no further than the
definite article” (<i>cf</i>., “azure” and “palace”). Of course, I cannot pass
by the mention of “mute e” without referring to “muteness”, silence, holding
one’s tongue, which is the lot of an oppressed minority, whether it be pre–Gay
Liberation gays or pre–Women’s Liberation females. Or <i>post–</i>, as it turns
out: the societal pressure not to speak for oneself, not to speak out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>I have thought about standardising and,
perhaps more importantly, codifying Polari’s spelling system for some time
(much as I wanted to reform Esperanto orthography as a teenager, not yet aware
of Guérard’s assertion that spending time on such an endeavor is nothing but a
“nice parlour game”). I abandoned my attempts years ago, just one in a long
line of people determined to “improve” Zamenhof’s creation. Perhaps I feel more
emboldened with Polari, or, for the purists — or for those who spoke a good
deal of Polari in their day — Nu-Polari (what I have done would be
unrecognisable to those people), for it does not boast of a “million speakers”,
has no academy nor a history of publication behind it; it is not taught in any
schools and is probably not even recognised as a language by most people.
Because Polari was never written down with any real authority, the spelling is
all over the place (and sometimes the pronunciation), with multiple variations on
the same word (take the word for shilling, which appears variously in Paul
Baker’s <i>Fantabulosa</i> as “<i>beone</i>”, “<i>beyong</i>”, “<i>beyonek</i>”,
“<i>bianc</i>”, “<i>bionc</i>”, <i>etc</i>.; I have standardised the word to <i>beeyoni</i>).
Even the word for “man”, the most common Polari word, along with <i>bona</i>,
“good”, could be written numerous ways (Baker lists seven variations in his <i>Dictionary
of Polari and Gay Slang</i>: <i>omee</i>, <i>omi</i>, <i>omy</i>, <i>omme</i>, <i>omer</i>,
<i>homee</i>, <i>homi</i>; I have settled on <i>omi</i>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>I wanted to rid Polari of such
superfluity by standardising and systematising the spelling — and spent six
months working out how. At first, I wanted the spelling to be basically English
with Italian for flavoring, which is the nature of the patois — and I did not
want to have to resort to accented letters. To begin with, I came up with
several spelling systems, but not with spelling rules that allowed for no
exceptions. (Regularity was one of the pillars of my project. As I wanted my
homonyms to have the same spelling, it meant I had to abandon the apostrophe
for elision, as mentioned elsewhere.) I tried to apply various English rules
for spelling across the board, but always foundered in the end. (I tried
writing <i>gajo</i>, outsider, originally a Romany word, as “gagio”, “ghago”,
“gadjo”, “gaejo”, “gajoe”, <i>etc</i>., with their systems applying to all the
other words in the lexicon, before ending up with the same spelling — but with
a rule to back it up — that Baker used.) Eventually, I ended up with the
regular, “phonetic” alphabet I have now, without the diacritical marks that mar
Esperanto, and with just a few “oddities” for the native English eye. I used
Baker’s word “Fantabulosa” as the basis for my regular system; hence, the “u”
with the palatal glide and the two uses of “a”. (Similarly, the two uses of “i”
in <i>parniing</i>; see “ey” and its asterisk, including the semi-vocalic
glide, for more information.) Zamehof would be twirling in his grave at my
permissive use of one letter to stand for more than one sound, and vice versa
(the schwa — the most common sound in the English language — gave me the most
trouble, before I ended up with <i>three</i> ways of representing it, albeit
with strict rules), but I am <i>katevva</i> enough to point out that the
letters “&#265;” and “&#285;” are actually made up of two sounds, thereby
contradicting Article 9 of Zamenhof’s own Sixteen Rules of Esperanto Grammar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The Polari I am aiming for is not just
the kind that has flavored comedians’ routines and occasionally dotted certain
memoirs, such as Kenneth Williams’ autobiography, the British television show
“Little Britain” or the oft-quoted and award-winning “Round the Horne” radio
programme of the 1960s. (In the treatise on camp — no, not Sontag’s — by
Quentin Crisp, <i>The Naked Civil Servant</i>, published in 1968, I expected to
find a profusion of Polari, but I was surprised to find none at all.) I call
English sprinkled with the odd word of Polari</span><span style='font-size:
11.0pt'>, </span><i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Paumi Polari</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> (English Polari), </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>such
as Carson Kressley’s penchant for <i>jhoojh</i> on the American television show
“Queer Eye for the Straight Guy”</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>. Paumi
Polari is little more than word substitution, with English syntax left largely
intact. In this way, it could be said to resemble what Étiemble dubbed <i>franglais</i>
in his book <i>parlez-vous franglais</i>, published in 1964, although
Singaporean English, or “Singlish” as it is known by the locals, is much closer
to Paumi Polari than <i>franglais</i> is. Nu-Polari, as I’ve come to call my
version (perhaps there is an ad man in me just dying to get out — <i>New and
improved Polari</i>), aims to be a complete system grafted on to the matrix
language, English. I am obviating the charge that Polari’s <i>raison d’être</i>
was to camouflage or obfuscate the speech of, mainly, gay men in a society
where homosexual acts were still a crime, for these decades later, I do not see
Polari in terms of mystification but potential unification for interested
speakers, <i>gay or straight</i>. In other words, a gay-based <i>fashernd</i>
language that has gone beyond its sexual roots (“pretersexual”) without
sacrificing its homosexual identity. Such potentiality is what is so attractive
to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Finally, what is a language without
apophthegms, I thought (that’s proverbs to you, Mary), so without further ado I
came up with, “<i>A shauka mouj iz bonar dhan a kaud sheikel</i>” (a silly hat
is better than a bad wig; that is, being silly on occasion, sending oneself up,
<i>etc</i>., is better than affectation as a trait, trying to fool others into
thinking you still have your own hair, which usually means some pretension to
authority, if you are straight; desirability, if you are gay). All the words in
my proverb are <i>bona</i> fide Polari, except <i>shauka</i>, which I took from
Italian <i>sciocca</i>, silly, in the grammatical feminine, conflating it with
the English <i>shocker</i>. (See “Expansion of Vocabulary”, below.)</span></p>
