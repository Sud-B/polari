<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:14.5pt'><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>(Particular)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.5pt'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.5pt'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>I have based the core of my Polari vocabulary on
Baker’s scholarship, for which I am most grateful, but it did seem to me that
he was over-generous in his attribution of a number of words and phrases to
Polari. For that reason, I have had to make an assessment of what I construed
as Polari, and what was not, in my opinion, Polari, before then contributing my
own extension to the lexicon. That is not to say that one may not use Cockney
or other slang in Polari, for I am trying not to be prescriptive in my
exclusions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>First, I examined Baker’s rationale for
the inclusion of certain words, and found that he relied almost exclusively on
the dialogue found in the 1960s British radio programme “Round the Horne” for
some words I would say are either doubtful or, strictly speaking, not Polari
words at all. Now, it seemed to me that just because either the character
Julian or Sandy used a particular word it was not sufficient reason to call
that word Polari. After all, the programme was broadcast in English, not
Polari. (When Jackie Mason liberally sprinkled his stand-up comic routine with
Yiddish words, no one maintained that he was speaking Yiddish.) English with a
smattering of Polari is thus nothing more than what I call Paumi Polari. For
example, Baker concedes that “cossy” appears just “once as a Polari word in <i>Round
the Horne</i>” (21). That is not enough for me to accept “cossy” as a pure
Polari word. Growing up in Australia, I heard the word “cossie” all the time,
something Baker himself concedes when he writes that the word is “frequently
heard in Australian soap operas” (21). In fact, <i>Chambers</i> specifically
calls “cossie” colloquial Australian (321). The same for “bod”, body, which I
presume is listed in Baker because it was uttered in <i>Round the Horne</i>,
but left <i>kaudi</i> and <i>lukaudi</i> as the Polari equivalents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Second, a Polari word derived from
Parlyaree, Romany or a blend is preferred to one derived from Cockney rhyming
slang, so if both appeared in Baker, I privileged the former over the latter.
Hence the omission of “dog and bone” (24) for <i>palari-peip</i>, “barnet” and
“ends” for <i>reir</i>, <i>etc</i>. (I wonder what those people who think I
live in a linguistic ivory tower make of the fact that one of the “languages”
automatic teller machines in the East End of London are offering customers is
Cockney, for three months at the end of 2009, at any rate. Banks, the epitome
of capitalism, indulging in a bit of linguistic adventurism in order to get
access to your “bladder of lard” [card]!) Cockney rhyming slang words were
retained, however, if I could find no alternative, as in <i>armernraux</i>,
“socks”. The idiom “color of his eyes”, used by <i>nelli kween</i> (his words,
my spelling) Ian Lucas as the title of an essay, is Cockney rhyming slang for
“penis size”, but in its current form it could hardly be called Polari, nor
even Paumi Polari. It would be like saying that “fait accompli”, though used in
English, is not French (although “crème de la crème” is a thoroughly English
confection made up of French ingredients; the French say <i>le gratin</i> or <i>le
dessus du panier</i>). For that reason, I have “Polarified” this idiom as <i>dha
tinta auv hir ogerlz</i>, and have done the same to other idioms listed in the
second, larger section of Baker’s book, “Dictionary of Gay Slang”, although I have
given the standard English equivalent only if it can be summarised in one or
two words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Third, I omitted gay and other kinds of
slang when there were already perfectly good Polari words for the same thing —
often listed in <i>Chambers</i> (such as “tat”). Take another glaring example,
“breast”. Baker lists no fewer than five so-called Polari words for this part
of the anatomy: <i>boob</i>, <i>foof</i>, <i>joob</i>, <i>nawk</i>, <i>willet</i>.
The word “boob” may be dismissed immediately, for it is in universal English
use — I defy anyone to call this word Polari! (</span><span style='font-size:
11.0pt'>Baker also lists “nawk”, but <i>Chambers</i> explains that “nork” — or
“norg”, as it is often heard in Australia among the general population — may
derive from Norco Co-operative Ltd, butter manufacturers in New South Wales
(978); I would have thought they were hardly the repository of Polari.</span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>) However, if I could not find a Polari word for such
and such a concept I retained the word, as in <i>dubi</i>, “pill”, deriving
from narcotic slang. (Although I could see no justification for “purple heart”
being listed as a Polari term by Baker; it should have appeared in his general
“Dictionary of Gay Slang”.) Similarly, I retained <i>shoumf</i> as the verb “to
swallow” in a general sense, reserving the more Polari <i>jhoojh</i> for a
sexual context. I also retained non-Polari slang words if they appeared in
conjunction with one or more Polari words (<i>bevvi-homi</i>, </span><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>nanti pautz in dha koubed</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>,<i> varda-vijhen</i></span><span style='font-size:
11.0pt'>). I Polarified the English component of such hybrid words, much as the
French think nothing of naturalising English words, especially when they take
on a slightly different meaning (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>fioul</i> for “fuel oil”).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Last — and this is being at my most
personal and unscientific — if my father ever used the word, a New Zealander
who had never heard of Polari, and would never have dreamt using it if he had,
then it was, in most cases, automatically discounted. I concede this is not a
very professional or linguistic approach, but it does explain why “boobs” or
“clobber” is not included here. “Boob” has already been dealt with, and “clobber”
would have been disqualified anyway, for there are already Polari words for
clothing (<i>jhoojh</i> is pure Polari, while <i>drayjh</i> is originally
English slang but given a make-over with a typical Polari long-vowel
displacement). I kept <i>barni</i>, however, even though “barney” is listed in <i>Chambers</i>
and, in my part of the world at any rate, is quite common, because I failed to
find a more appropriate and genuine Polari, Parlyaree or Romany word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>I applied the same measures for all
other sources. I did not include a term if the source was unable to furnish a
meaning, as “dredge”, found in Young, for instance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.5pt'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.5pt'><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Expansion of Vocabulary:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.5pt'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>I have worked extensively on expanding the vocabulary.
I came up with all sorts of extensions to existing meanings (identified by °),
such as <i>rozi</i> as a verb, or the second meaning of <i>bilidu</i> as a
letter of any sort. In some cases, I simply utilised what was already there.
For example, <i>kakeling fart</i> is given as an egg in Baker, whereas I saw
this immediately as a contracted form for “hen’s egg”, <i>i.e</i>., <i>kakeling
[pelone-]cheetz fart</i>, which is what we all do when we refer to eggs at the
supermarket. In this way, <i>fart</i> is an egg and <i>kakeling</i>, or any
other word is its attributive (<i>chikerlz fart</i>, bird’s egg). So, under the
headword <b>fart</b>, one finds its first English equivalent is indeed “fart”,
but then I have added “egg”. It is not so far-fetched to consider the second
meaning an extension of the first, for both issue from the fundament, the
former in a volatile flatus which may at times smell like rotten-egg gas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>A few other words used in Polari to have
had their use expanded include, <i>larda</i>, <i>paut</i> and <i>velvet</i>. In
the case of <i>velvet</i>, the fact that it may refer to “vulva” or a man’s
anus is not so unusual. English contains the same ambiguity in “fanny”, for
instance, depending on which side of the Atlantic you are on. According to
Hennig, the same ambiguity with regard to erogenous zones exists in French,
where the slang <i>panier</i>, “basket”, may have derived from <i>panil</i>,
which, as early as the thirteenth century, referred to both anus and vulva
(also see in the etymology for “koul”, below).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>From looking at words that already
existed in Polari, but perhaps in a different context or in a limited use, I
proceeded to augment the vocabulary by taking words from Polari’s traditional
etymological sources: thieves’ cant, Italian, Romany and Yiddish, and, in a
very limited way, Anglo-Indian (all identified by an asterisk),* some words of
which have entered popular parlance (such as “palaver”). Baker quoted some
words as Polari that I have replaced with other words from one of these source
languages, or combined with existing Polari words, for they did not seem
particularly Polari — or even gay — to me. Hence, I propose <i>janka</i> for
“billingsgate”, originally from Hindi “</span><i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>jhakna</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>” and once used in Anglo-Indian slang (metathetically,
the word now rhymes with “wanker”). I was going to propose <i>hart-eek</i> for
“heartface”, too, but apart from the fact that it sounds too much like
“heartache” (I am not that cynical!), I have decided to keep it as an example
of gay slang used in Polari.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Initially, I was going to sprinkle some
Esperanto in the mix to round out some vocabulary that I thought needed to be
Polarified, even though Esperanto was never a part of Polari’s history of
development. After all, if it was good enough for the signage in “Red Dwarf”,
with its fair sprinkling of gay innuendo, I thought Esperanto would have been
acceptable here. But in the end, I decided against straying so far from
Polari’s roots. At any rate, I am not so sure Zamenhof would have approved. All
this talk of Esperanto reminds me of an anecdote on a visit to George Bernard
Shaw, who was most keen himself to reform English spelling along phonetic
lines, by someone who had moved over to the Ido camp. He asked Shaw’s advice on
an agent form for those who speak Ido. “ ‘Esperantist’ sounds so natural,” the
visitor explained, “whereas ‘Idoist’ is rather difficult to say. What would you
suggest?” “How about ‘Idiot’?” Shaw suggested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Before I say goodbye to Esperanto, I
would like to add that the title of Cat Stevens’ album <i>Mona Bone Jakon</i>
had intrigued me for more than 30 years. It is not Esperanto, but I wondered if
it was Ido or Novesperanto or some such offshoot. It never occurred to me that
it might be Polari. <i>Bona</i> (or <i>bonar</i>, as Kenneth Williams wrote it,
which in Nu-Polari is the comparative form of <i>bona</i>), is a common Polari
word, but perhaps cant accounted for the other two words. Cant Stevens? “Mona”,
always with a capital M, is slang for money in Gayle, the gay slang of South Africa, but this is merely a faux ami. (A website finally solved the mystery — it is
a neologism of Cat Stevens’ own making for his <i>bagaja</i>.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>I also expanded the meaning of certain
words already found in a limited sense in Polari, such as <i>arnt</i>, as the
opposite of <i>nanti</i>, or <i>larda</i> in the expression “</span><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>narda ta varda in dha larda</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>”. In this way, it was a natural extension to have <i>larda</i>,
rather than “bulge” or “basket”, common gay slang words for crotch, or any of
the other such myriad terms, to become the Polari word of choice, and for this
reason it appears in the Vocabulary without an asterisk following it. In
addition to extending meanings to existing Polari words or English words used
in a Polari context, I used this existing vocabulary to calque and create quite
a number of neologisms, such as <i>rozi-cheet</i>, which neologising could
preoccupy one for quite some time, as well as patterned new terms on old ones,
such as <i>bona shoding</i> (from <i>bona vardering</i>) or <i>nab dha nab</i>,
patterned on English repetitions as “fight the fight”, “sing a song”, <i>etc</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;line-height:
14.5pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>To show what I mean, allow me to
illustrate <i>lib</i>, which was originally a cant word, meaning either sleep
or the place where one puts one’s head down to sleep. As Polari already has
another word for sleep, <i>letti</i> (from Italian <i>letto</i>, bed), I have
extended <i>lib</i>’s linguistic range to include sleeping rough and sleeping
or resting for a bit, as well for the plea, <i>Tip ya moudha a lib!</i> (<i>i.e</i>.,
Give me a break!). Polari, in its unregulated unruliness, had both <i>nish</i>
and <i>nix</i> for “no”, so I kept <i>nix</i> as it was but turned <i>nish</i>
into a verb, meaning “to give up, to stop, to cease”. So, for example, the
equivalent of “Stop talking!” would be <i>Nish</i><i> dha kakel!</i> Polari had
yet another word for no, “nishta”, which I have retained (as two words) for
protest slogans and the like, equivalent to “no [to]” (<i>Nish ta nu taxiz!</i>)
and signs (<i>Nish</i><i> ta voging</i>, No smoking — compare that to <i>nish
dha voging</i>, stop smoking). I have built up quite a vocabulary from Borrow’s
list of Romany in his books, as well as coined a couple of neologisms of my own
(<i>milzermb’une</i> and <i>barberella</i> — amazing restraint for someone who
has created his own private language, Taneraic) and expanded the number system
up to a million (see in “A Word or Two on Syntax”, below.) In addition to <i>tip
ya moudha a lib!</i>, I have used <i>tip</i>, cant for “give” (it is only in
recent times that “tip”, meaning a gratuity, has become respectable,
linguistically speaking; before then, it was always viewed with suspicion), in
a number of expressions, such as <i>tip dha nab tu</i>, approve [of]
(literally, give the nod to). Some people probably know it from “Tipping the
Velvet”, the title of an English lesbian saga on television a few years ago,
which is Polari for cunnilingus dressed up in (nonsensical) English. (Similarly,
the Special Broadcast Service [</span><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>SBS</span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>] television in Australia ran a video-clip pop music
show called “Eat Carpet” for many years, which also means cunnilingus in slang.
Speaking of titles, I am sure John Waters would agree that </span><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Roze Flemingoze</span></i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>
sounds every bit as good as <i>Pink Flamingos</i>, if not better, due to the
alliterating rhyme.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.5pt'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.5pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>* Borrowings adopted for this reconstruction of Polari
are indicated by an asterisk after the headword only (<i>e.g</i>., <b>dives*</b>).
Note that Polari words given extended meanings or even new meanings are
indicated by a degree sign (°) after their English equivalents; however, Polari
words used in new combinations are not specially marked (<i>e.g</i>., <b>vardering
vakarya</b>), nor are words taken from Gayle. English words used in the body of
the Vocabulary are also given their own entry, but are not specifically marked
with an asterisk (<i>e.g</i>., <b>att</b>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.5pt'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>The most notable feature of Polari is use of the
redundant definite article, especially when English uses the indefinite article
(</span><i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>voge dha dubi</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>). The next most notable feature is Polari’s
predilection for the paraphrase (<i>hei in dha vauchi</i>). Overall, Polari <i>as
she was spoke</i> follows English syntax. However, with my proposition for an
extension of the lexicon, along with an expansion of meaning of existing Polari
words, I have come up with some changes worth mentioning:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.5pt'><span

style='font-size:11.0pt'>Numbers</span></b><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>.
Baker listed Polari numbers from one to twelve </span><span style='font-size:
11.0pt'>(just two fingers more than two hands, twelve being the magical
phallometrical number)</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>, as well as the
Parlyaree equivalents for six to nine, but that was it. I wanted the same
limitless potential to count found in all natural languages, so I adapted two
words from the Polari lexicon, <i>laung</i> and <i>deja</i>, changed the use of
<i>lepta</i>, created a new meaning for <i>jent</i> and created new words for
thousand, million and billion. As the Nu-Polari number system is independent
from the English system, there is no question of simple substitution, but
should be learned separately. The number system I have devised is logical,
straightforward and easily mastered (although English has nothing on French
tortuousness, such as <i>quatre</i>-<i>vingt</i>-<i>un</i>, 81; <i>lit</i>.,
four [times]-twenty-one).</span></p>
